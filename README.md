Welcome to the project repository for POPE (Promptable Pose Estimation), a state-of-the-art technique for 6-DoF pose estimation of any object in any scene using a single reference.

## Web Demo

To view the zero-shot promptable pose estimation results, including indoor and outdoor testing, as well as comparisons with Gen6D and LoFTR, please visit our `demo.html`.

The demo showcasing the performance of our proposed `POPE` algorithm:

### Zero-shot Promtable Pose Estimation

Some Visual Examples of Promptable Object Pose Estimation Test Cases on Outdoor, indoor and scene with severe occlutions.

### Application on Novel View Synthesis

We show the Application of Novel View Synthesis, by leveraging the estimated object poses, our method generate photo-realistic rendering results.

### Comparison based on Video and Image

We show Visualizations on LINEMOD, YCB-Video, OnePose and OnePose++ datasets, with the comparison with LoFTR and Gen6D.

## Appendix

For more detailed quantitative results on each dataset (LINEMOD, YCB-Video, OnePose, OnePose++), please refer to the `appendix.pdf`.

The appendix contains comprehensive information and evaluation metrics that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our POPE technique.
